# 👋 Hi there! I’m Miracle Chibuike, a passionate Front-End Engineer with over 3 years of hands-on experience building responsive, high-performing, and user-friendly web applications.

- 💻 I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and React.js, and I’m currently expanding my skill set with Node.js and PHP to strengthen my full-stack development capabilities.

- 🚀 I’ve built and contributed to several real-world projects — including business websites, educational platforms, feedback collection apps, and interactive web apps — all focused on usability, scalability, and clean UI/UX design.

- 🌍 I’m also an active open-source contributor, having collaborated on school management systems, community-based projects, and other collaborative GitHub repositories that focus on solving real-world challenges through code.

- 🎓 Beyond coding, I work as a Front-End Development Instructor, where I teach both beginner and advanced web technologies — guiding aspiring developers to understand core programming concepts, responsive design principles, and modern web practices.
